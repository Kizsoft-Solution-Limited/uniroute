# API Keys Explained: UniRoute vs AI Providers

## 🔑 Understanding the Two Types of API Keys

When using UniRoute, there are **two completely different types of API keys**:

---

## 1. UniRoute API Keys (Your Access to UniRoute)

### What They Are
- **Your authentication key** to use UniRoute's API
- **Format**: `ur_abc123def456...` (starts with `ur_`)
- **Who provides**: **UniRoute** (you get this from UniRoute)

### How to Get One
- **Self-hosted**: Generated by UniRoute when you create an API key
- **Hosted service**: Get from UniRoute dashboard after signup

### Where to Use
```javascript
// In your application code
const response = await fetch('https://api.uniroute.dev/v1/chat', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ur_your-uniroute-key'  // ← This is your UniRoute key
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [...]
  })
});
```

### Purpose
- Authenticate your requests to UniRoute
- Track your usage
- Apply rate limits
- Manage access control

### Cost
- **FREE** - UniRoute API keys are free to create
- **Usage charges apply** - You pay UniRoute for AI model usage (ONLY when using managed service)
- **FREE with BYOK** - No charges when you provide your own provider keys
- **FREE when self-hosting** - No charges when self-hosting UniRoute
- No cost to create or manage UniRoute API keys

## 2. AI Provider API Keys (Your Access to AI Models)

### What They Are
- **API keys from AI providers** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- **Format**: 
  - OpenAI: `sk-...`
  - Anthropic: `sk-ant-...`
  - Google: `AIza...`
- **Who provides**: **YOU** (you get these from the providers directly)

### How to Get Them

#### OpenAI
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign up or log in
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

#### Anthropic
1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to API Keys
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

#### Google
1. Go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `AIza`)

### Where to Configure

#### Self-Hosted UniRoute
```bash
# In your .env file or environment variables
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-anthropic-key-here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza-your-google-key-here
```

#### Hosted UniRoute (if available)
- Configure in your UniRoute dashboard
- Settings → Provider API Keys
- Enter your keys securely

### Purpose
- UniRoute uses these keys to make requests to AI providers
- **On your behalf** - UniRoute acts as a proxy
- You're still the one paying the providers

### Cost (BYOK Model)
- **You pay the providers directly**
- OpenAI bills you for OpenAI usage
- Anthropic bills you for Anthropic usage
- Google bills you for Google usage
- **UniRoute doesn't charge for using your provider keys**

### Cost (Managed Service Model)
- **UniRoute bills you** (includes provider costs)
- UniRoute pays the providers on your behalf
- Unified billing through UniRoute
- Pay-as-you-go pricing

## 🔄 How It Works Together

### The Flow:

```
Your Application
      ↓
   [Uses UniRoute API Key: ur_abc123...]
      ↓
   UniRoute Gateway
      ↓
   [Uses Provider API Keys: sk-..., sk-ant-..., AIza...]
      ↓
   AI Providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
      ↓
   Response back through UniRoute
      ↓
   Your Application
```

### Example Request Flow:

1. **Your app** sends request with **UniRoute API key**:
   ```javascript
   POST /v1/chat
   Authorization: Bearer ur_your-uniroute-key
   ```

2. **UniRoute** validates your UniRoute API key
   - Checks if key is valid
   - Applies rate limits
   - Logs the request

3. **UniRoute** uses **your provider API keys** to call AI providers:
   - Uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` to call OpenAI
   - Uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to call Anthropic
   - Uses `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to call Google

4. **AI providers** bill **YOU directly** (not UniRoute)

5. **UniRoute** returns the response to your app
